# NLP-content-moderation
This is a content moderation system that uses NLP and deep learning techniques to classify a inputed text in different classes that are:


- [ ] Spam
  - [ ] Click-bait
  - [ ] Bot generated content
- [ ] Toxic
  -Â [ ] Contains bad word
  - [ ] Offensive content
  - [ ] Explicit content
  - [ ] Violent content

To achieve this task I am going to create a NLP processing pipeline using Spacy library and I am then going to create a FastAPI.
